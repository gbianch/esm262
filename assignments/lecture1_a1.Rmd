I am taking this course to expand my technical skills in the environmental field. I enjoy data analysis, and I think this course will help me learn more to improve my workflow. I am also the data manager for my group project, so I want make sure my data management is understandable/reproducible when it comes time to submit the metadata.


My data science background began when I came to Bren. The relevant courses I have taken are 206 and 244 which I am currently enrolled in. Prior to Bren, I had a little experience using R and Python, but it wasn't in a data science application.
