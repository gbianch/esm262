This code reads in a dataset containing a list of fish observations and tests a fish_diversity function to determine the total number of fish, the most common and least common species. 

```{r}
fishURL <- ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naomitague/ESM_262_Examples/main/Data/fish.txt") # URL from github
fish <- read_csv(fishURL) # read file in as csv

# rename column name
colnames(fish)[1] = "type"
```

```{r}
fish_diversity(fish)
```
